      <description>Airflow healthcheck I&amp;rsquo;ve been running Airflow for some years and in my experience, the scheduler sometimes gets stuck. I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out why this happens, and to my knowledge, no one else has. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from using Airflow but the issue needs to be addressed or it will bite you at some point, because your pipelines will stall.
I read the article Airflow on AKS this week and it is a good overview of how to deploy Airflow on AKS.</description>

      <description>Guide to Airflow on Kubernetes Recently I spend quite some time diving into Airflow and Kubernetes. While there are reports of people using them together, I could not find any comprehensive guide or tutorial. Also, there are many forks and abandoned scripts and repositories. So you need to do some research.
Here I write down what I&amp;rsquo;ve found, in the hope that it is helpful to others. Because things move quickly, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to put this on Github rather than in a blog post, so it can be easily updated.</description>
