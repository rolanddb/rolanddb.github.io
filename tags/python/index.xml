      <description>Recently we were running into the problem that our Airflow server got &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo; - it just stopped doing anything, without any logging, errors, or weird CPU or memory usage. A restart resolved the issue, and we have healthchecks in place that detect these forms of stalling and automatically restart the scheduler. But since the issue occurred multiple times in a short time period, I figured that this was a good time to do a deep dive, since normally these issues are hard to reproduce.</description>
